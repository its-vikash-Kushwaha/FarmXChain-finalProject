Project Title:
FarmChainX – AI-Powered Farm Product Traceability System

Project Statement:
FarmChainX is a blockchain-inspired, AI-enabled platform that ensures transparent
traceability of agricultural products from farm to fork. The system uses AI for anomaly
detection, predictive quality scoring, and integrates QR-based tracking for stakeholders
such as farmers, distributors, and consumers. Built using Spring Boot, Angular 19, and
MySQL, it offers role-based dashboards for real-time product visibility, ensuring food
safety, authenticity, and quality assurance in the agriculture supply chain.
